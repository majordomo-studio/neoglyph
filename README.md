# NeoGlyph

A plug-n-play component library for data visualization.

This is still under active development - all components are working.

## Installation

npx @majordomo.studio/neoglyph@latest add databricks

# or
npx @majordomo.studio/neoglyph@latest add datagrid
```

Components will be installed to the ui folder.

## Usage
